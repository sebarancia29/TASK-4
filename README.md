# TASK-4
 Sudoku Solver in C
This is a C program that solves a standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using the **backtracking algorithm**. Developed as part of **Task-04** of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.
The program:
1. Scans the Sudoku grid for an empty cell.
2. Tries placing digits from 1â€“9 while checking validity (row, column, and 3x3 box).
3. Uses **backtracking** to correct invalid placements.
4. Stops when the puzzle is solved.
